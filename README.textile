h1. Red Hat Network command line API tools

This is a would-like-to-expand collection of command line tools which interact with the Red Hat Network API.

h3. extract_affected_systems.py

Red Hat constantly alerts its paying customers via email of the errata when published on rhn.redhat.com . Assuming you've got such a notification, if you want to investigate further and find out which systems are affected by the advisory you can use this python tool:

<pre>
$ python extract_affected_systems.py -a "RHSA-2012:0350" -u gfidente@redhat.com -p $YOURPASS
Systems list...
one.example.com
four.example.com
...
</pre>

you can also list the packages affected by the advisory (which need to be updated):

<pre>
$ python extract_affected_systems.py -a "RHSA-2012:0350" -u gfidente@redhat.com -p $YOURPASS -P
Systems list...
one.example.com
four.example.com
...
Packages list...
kernel-2.6.32
kernel-debug-2.6.32
...
</pre>

Enjoy.
